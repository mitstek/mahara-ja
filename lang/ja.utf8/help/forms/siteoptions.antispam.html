<h3>アンチスパム</h3>

<p>パブリックに閲覧可能なフォーラムに対して、3つのレベルのアンチスパムプロテクションを利用することができます。There are three levels of anti-spam protection available for publicly
visible forms, such as the Contact Us and Registration forms. A form
submission is never silently rejected. Rather, an error message is displayed
asking the user to try again if the submission is classified as spam.</p>

<p><b>None: </b>No anti-spam checks will be performed on form submissions.</p>

<p><b>Simple: </b>Some basic checks are performed. Form submissions with email
addresses that are not well-formed, or that have an excessive number of URLs,
are rejected.</p>

<p><b>Advanced: </b>(Requires an internet connection). Performs additional
checks to determine whether email addresses are real, or contained URLs are
blacklisted.</p>
